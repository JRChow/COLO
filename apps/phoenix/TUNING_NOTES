TUNING_NOTES File

This file documents the performance tuning strategies that users could employ
for their specific environment.


1. Application Tunables
-----------------------

1.1. Data Chunk Size

With the user specified splitter function, the Phoenix library splits the input
data into multiple chunks, so that a map task operates on a single data chunk 
at a time. By default each chunk size roughly amounts to L1 cache size (64 KB).
Generally speaking, increasing the chunk size could enhance performance by
improving the computation to communication ratio. However, increasing the chunk
size too much would result in significant load imbalance. 

Users can experiment with varying chunk sizes by exporting the environment 
variable MR_L1CACHESIZE. In each of the application source code, recommended 
setting is also denoted in comments.
