== Background == 
High availability solutions such as micro checkpoint and COLO will do
consecutive checkpoints. The VM state of the Primary and Secondary VM is
identical right after a VM checkpoint, but becomes different as the VM
executes till the next checkpoint. To support disk contents checkpoint,
the modified disk contents in the Secondary VM must be buffered, and are
only dropped at next checkpoint time.

== Non-shared disk workflow ==
The following is the image of block replication workflow:

    1) Primary write requests will be copied and forwarded to Secondary
       QEMU.
    2) Before Primary write requests are written to Secondary disk, the
       original sector content will be read from Secondary disk and
       buffered in the Disk buffer. (To ensure memory-vcpu / disk state
       consistency in the secondary VM).
    3) Primary write requests will be written to Secondary disk.
    4) Secondary write requests will be buffered in the Disk buffer and it
       will overwrite the existing sector content in the buffer.
